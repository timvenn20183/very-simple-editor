The purpose of the Venn Editor is to write a very simple editor in order to understand
the basic concepts of editor design. This with a view to later creating an editor for a home
grown operating system. 

The other driving force behind the project is to gain some workable experience with C++ and 
ncurses on a text console.

Please note that this editor is by no means a complete, full featured editor. The purpose of this 
editor is to understand what would be required to build a simple editor. I am sure there are many
ways to improve on the way in which certain features have been implemented.

The editor is divided into smaller modules and each handles a specific section:

- Main
- Screen 
- Keyboard
- File
- Memory
- Other

To compile simply use the existing Makefile and type:

make
